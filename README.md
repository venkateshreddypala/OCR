Think about all the litereature that has been in writing from the time that has been written on leaves and rocks, individuals and companies (Home Entertainment)are now trying to build especially with languages targetted that has not been done previously by their competitors, How can I help to solve by storing these literature works for induviduals to look by and companies to target particular language base? 

What if we used artificial intelligence to process these questions to interact with us in our language and store all the work done in literature that can be referenced by the people in future or companies to develop chatbots and improving the exisitng sytems to index and search in documents of that particualar language for a given phrase?

This application is just a beginning for entusiasts to build upon, this application is done on  a trail and error based and can be enhanced with better frameworks that addresses this particular framework in a less time with more precision, I try to release build iterattively and improve the performance.

There are challanges there are issues, in this selected project which will be adressed.
